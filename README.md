# HopeCore

[HopeCore](https://hopecore.onrender.com)

A simple system using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This system uses JSON Web Tokens, and Google OAuth to authenticate users.

This allows users to login using their Google Account. When a user logs in, they are given a JSON Web Token which is used to authenticate when adding quotes in the database.


## Todo
- Make user change their name
- User can manage entered quotes (Update and Delete)
- Design??? Maybe no
